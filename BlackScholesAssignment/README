Step1: Decompress the input file (Sample_SPX_20151001_to_20151030.csv).

You can do that on the server using:

   gunzip Sample_SPX_20151001_to_20151030.csv.gz

Source was this (You might find other files to test from there as well)

(see "SPX Sample Download")


Step2: make

    module load intel/compiler/64
    make

Step3: ./BS_hackaton

Run on the Phi:

    srun -p xeonphi ./BS_hackaton




NOTE: the makefile.mak is not related to the project, but it's a Makefile that
was used for a real Xeon Phi project (although an older model) that does
something similar to the exercise. So that's why we still included it, in case
you start optimizing you may find interesting flags in it.
